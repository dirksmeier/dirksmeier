# Mathias Dirksmeier's README

Hi, I’m Mathias. I’m currently working as head of product at [neon](https://www.neon-free.ch/). I wrote this page to help others understand what it is like to work with me, primarily but not exclusively for folks that haven't worked with me before.

It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building trust by being intentionally vulnerable and sharing my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team. I actively encourage you to contribute to this page by opening a merge request. 

Thank you to the people who have contributed improvements or ideas to this document:

## Some things about me
I grew up in small-town Germany, a son to the world's capital city for plums - hence my genetic disposition for plum cake. After having lived in various places around the world, i.a. China, Malaysia, Cameroon, and California, I ended up in Zurich, Switzerland. I'm an industrial engineer by training, interned a lot in the automotive industry, then worked in Renewable Energies research before ultimately finding my profession in product management. Definitely no common thread here.

### Some things I like
* (Outdoor) sports. I grew up playing soccer but eventually gave it up to have more time for snowboarding, climbing, mountain biking, bouldering, and skating, ... yet, I also love to play badminton, beach volleyball, squash, and spikeball. I guess I simply love to move!
* With the same passion but hardly any talent I like to play on my ramshackle piano or an old guitar I got from my mom.
* I also follow some sports quite enthusiastically, and I have a weird obsession with Lewis Hamilton, Lebron James, and Pat Mahomes.
* Working with my hands. I spent the Covid time converting a transporter into a proper, winter-ready camping van. I really enjoy spending time away from any screen.
* Being alone.

### Some things I dislike
* Being told what to do.
* Certain types of people (snotty, self-absorbed, superficial, dishonest, deceitful, spineless, cowardly, disrespectful).
* Brussels sprout.
* Going with the obvious, easy, boring solution when there is so much potential for creativity

### Values that are important to me
* Boldness: This has many facets. I like people to be direct with me, just as much as I like to be direct with people. I love to storm ahead and try things out. I am most of the time very self-confident, but also very much willing to err. I value strong opinions and I don't believe in hierarchies.
* Humility: I strive to understand my weaknesses and get to the core of who I really am. I know that I fail a lot. This knowledge eradicates any reason to create illusional portrayals of myself for others and myself. I also know that I fail a lot at that.
* Kindness: I find a lot of joy in being kind; not to be confused with being nice. Kindness is about showing you care about people and their development, about being empathetic. I feel enormously privileged in this life and it's my duty to give back.
* Foolishness: I am not taking myself too seriously and I can laugh a great deal about myself. In the same way, I approach rather serious matters in life and I strongly believe in the healing abilities of humor. I am aware that this can be disturbing to some.

## At work

### Why I work at neon

### My working/leadership style
* I feel a deep ownership for the products I work with. That often leaves me struggling to find a balance between my personal life and my work life. This is an area of growth for me, and I’m grateful to others when they chastise me for working too much.
* I strongly believe in empowerment. I trust that you are the highest qualified person to take the right decisions about your product. I will always be there to challenge you, or mentor you or just be a buddy for you. That also means I will hold you accountable for the impact you have on your product and the people around you.
* Unless specifically mentioned, I don’t expect immediate responses from anyone. I respect others’ time and want you to have the space for a thoughtful response.
* Whenever possible, I co-design change experiments with team members. A big group of passive participants grinds to a halt. A small group of vested individuals can carry something forward. I don't strive to become the "figurehead" for any particular change effort. I am happy to let others take the limelight and represent the effort.
* If we have a recurring 1x1, that time belongs to you. These interactions are very important to me and are dedicated to whatever topic you’re interested in discussing with me. They’re not status meetings unless you’d like them to be.
* I tend to make suggestions and asks, never commands. However, at times my strong opinions may come across as such, please say so and I’ll do my best to adjust my style.
* I share feedback outright and enjoy receiving it myself. I also try to express gratitude frequently. This is genuine. 
* Sometimes, my calendar will be packed with meetings. Please DM me if you can’t find time, I will always make time for you.

### Things I must improve (based on my own insights and shared feedback)
* I have strong opinions. Paired with my sense of ownership, I sometimes give in to my emotions and can come across as uncompromising or impatient.
* When I hear about a problem, I want to directly contribute to the solution - which isn't always the best use of my time. My TODO list tends to grow exponentially if I don't say "no" to things.
* Growing up in the outskirts of the German Ruhrgebiet shaped by industrial heritage, multiculturalism, and steadfast, unpretentious workers has instilled in me a rather dark/dry humor. I had to learn how this humor can be offensive to some. I need to improve my empathy in these situations and better read social cues.
* I tell my team to protect their work-life balance; I monitor the amount of time the team takes, and bug people when they're not taking a minimum number of days off. However, I do a poor job of setting a good example by not watching over my own time off. I know that people look far closer at my actions instead of my words.
* It is a trivial thing to say that I need to listen more, but it is very hard to act on. I am convinced that I learn much more from listening than from talking and often times listening is all that is required from me. I need to find a better balance here, and I think I did a better job at that in my younger years.

### My role as a product leader
If you’re on my team, I’m here to support you, provide focus and clarity on our most important problems, and advocate for you and the things you ship. I serve you, and we should optimize the things we do together for the organization. I'm still trying to learn more about setting organizational-level focus and getting everyone excited about the direction.

I'm trying to help you in a few ways:
* Provide you with context. I do a lot of communicating with people you might not be otherwise exposed to, and I hope to shield you from things that aren’t as important and provide you with clarity on the things that are.
* Pair with you on problems. You’ll know your area of the product better than I do, but I’ll be close enough to have some informed thoughts of my own.
* Help you directly whenever you need it, whether that is by writing documentation, taking meeting notes so that you can focus, or brainstorming ideas with you.
* Be an avid supporter of your career path. Your career belongs to you, and I want to cheerlead and support you on your path; this includes exposing you to opportunities that allow you to grow. I don’t want you to be bored!

### How you can help me
* Do thoughtful, good work.
* Tell me if there's something preventing you from this, and we'll work together on fixing it. Communication is key.
* Default to action and take ownership. Instead of waiting, move problems forward.
* Structure is very important to me. Please make use of templates and processes that the team agreed upon.
* Be aware of the example you set for others in the team.

### What I assume about you
* Positive intent.
* You’re better at your job than I am!
* If I disagree with you, I may try to steer you down a different path. But my disagreeing with you doesn’t mean that you’re doing something wrong.
* You’ll ask for my input and help if it’s needed.
* Work is absolutely not the most important thing in your life. I assume that there are cherished relationships and personal interests that are more important to your happiness, and it’s hard to be happy with your job when work detracts from those things.
